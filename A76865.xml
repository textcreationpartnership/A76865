            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ON Friday laſt the Kings Forces fallied out of the Caſtle with a ſtrong party of Horſe and foot, and fell upon our Horſe and Foot
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162357:3"/>Guards neer the lower Church, with ſuch undanted courage, that they ſoon ſurprized many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, beating them off from their Works, and ſeizing upon their Arms, ſtill embracing the purſuiz, till they came almoſt to the Market place, thinking to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſole Conquerors of the Beſiegers, and indeed had indangered the raiſing of the ſiege, had not Collonell <hi>Rainsborough</hi> appeared in the nick of time, who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the enemies chief Body, conſiſting of ſeventy horſe and one hundred foot, diſputed the place with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gallantry, but they were moſt puiſſantly received by the other party, who charged the Collonel in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Military Poſture, ſome of their muſquetiers flanking the horſe, the reſt firing in the Van of them, and wheeling off betwixt the Files.</p>
            <p>During which diſpute, divers fell on both ſides, and at laſt Colonell <hi>Rainsborough</hi> fore't his paſſage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their Body of Horſe, which cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in a very diſorderly manner, moſt of the Foot being left ingaged.</p>
            <p>The Colonel purſued them to the very Caſtle gates where a morter-piece charged with Granadoes were fired at them, which did ſome execution: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were remanded back to a further diſtance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Enemy attempted another ſalley, thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king to carry off their wounded men, but being ſore galled with our muſquetiers, retreated in again, and left them to the mercy of our ſouldiers, who brought them priſoners into the high town, procured Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to dreſſe their wounds, and after examination were committed to ſafe cuſtody.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162357:3"/>
            <p> In this Conflict we loſt about 20 men, one gallant Troop of Horſe totally ruined, the Captain Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Cornet, and about thirty Troopers taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>Of the enemies ſide were ſlain, neer upon fifteen, and twenty of their Foor ſouldiers, a Lientenant and eight troopers taken.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Bonivant</hi> who commanded the Van of the Enemies Horſe, was ſhot in the left arme, Since which time he hath made another ſalley forth of the Caſtle, and killed ten of our men upon the place; and often times adventures ten or twelve miles into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and bring in the Gentry thereof priſoners, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Booty and proviſion, without any oppoſition: So that this ſiege is managed very abſurdly, if not treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, for the enemies forces are exceedingly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within; but dare not take their progreſſe as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, being limited to a narrower diſtance, ſince the conjnnction of our Forces with Colonell <hi>Rainsbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This morning they attempted another ſalley Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Huddleston</hi> commanding in chief, our foot guards received them, and gave them a volley; which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered again by the Enemies Foot: and after ſome diſpute the enemy retreated; but being within Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Canon, durſt not follow the purſuit; ſo that they re-poſſeſſed themſelves of their Sanctuary with the loſſe of five men: on our part were ſlain two and three wounded. The great Ordnance from their ſeverall Towres doth very much annoy us, doing exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on our men as they lye in their Forts and tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c.</p>
